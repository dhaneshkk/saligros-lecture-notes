#The theory of centers#
  -A “center” is a visual field that is the focus of a region
  -The region that focuses on a “center” can be of any size
  -Centers help to tie the space together by reinforcement
  -Recursion leads to fractal properties
  -Center is void of duality
  -It's a geometerical Focus of the system
      -Well defined - Well defined structure sourounded by looser boundry
      -implied - void is sourounded by structured boundry.
      
      -Both “defined” and “implied” centers are the foci for their surrounding structures
      -“Defined” and “implied” centers can overlap, thus helping each other 
      -In a coherent design, all the centers cooperate to reinforce each other • 
      
      Smaller centers combine to form larger centers — recursive property
      #A. “Defined” or “explicit” centers
          -A region in which something right in the middle focuses the structure
          -The focal point draws attention to the actual center of a region
      #B. “Implied” or “latent” centers
          -A region that focuses on its central point, but where the middle is empty
          -Surrounding structure is helping to focus attention towards the interior
          -This is a boundary effect — the boundary is focusing on the implied center.

#Algorithm for generating centers#
Expected Result :Success means that centers blend together.

-1. Create both strong “defined” and “implicit” centers on a particular scale.
-2. Place/create smaller centers, so that they are nested within larger centers.
-3. Use symmetries to make centers cooperate, so they support each other geometrically.


Can be achieved by Adaptivity and asymmetry
• We are encouraging the formation of a high density of local symmetries, not an overall symmetry
• ASYMMETRY arises from adaptation, usually seen on larger scales.
• But there needs to be a reason for asymmetry, not just personal whim.

  #Rules

    1. “Every time you create a center on a particular scale, 
        make sure that it reinforces the centers on the immediately smaller scale, 
        and the centers on the immediately larger scale”
    2. “Begin by visualizing the whole. 
        Then identify the scale that is the weakest, or is missing. 
        Create or intensify a center on that scale. 
        The new center must reinforce all existing centers on its own scale, as well as follow rule 1.”

#How to do:

#Example: find a weakness
• Problem: some part of your design feels wrong
    • Don’t just adjust that piece, but look at that SCALE in the entire design
    • Ask: WHAT IS THE BEST CENTER THAT REINFORCES THIS SCALE?
• Solution: implement that center, rather than adjusting the original faulty piece

#Starting from weakness
• Usually start from the site, which may contain a weak system of centers
• Apply successful transformations
• Each step creates new centers, or reinforces existing weak centers
• All centers reinforce each other to create a coherent whole

#Helmut Leitner's center-generating transformations
• 1. Stepwise: Perform one step at a time
• 2. Reversible: Test design decisions using models;“trial and error”; if it doesn’t work, undo it
• 3. Structure-preserving: Each step builds upon what is already there
• 4. Design from weakness: Each step improves coherence
• 5. New from existing: Emergent structure combines what is already there into new form


#High-level description
• Algorithm: larger main loop computes architectural harmony
• Several nested secondary iterative loops act as constraints:

#Alexander’s first and second algorithms
• 1. Identify the weakest or missing center that forms a bottleneck in the harmony of the configuration
• 2. Intensify that center
• 3. Act both locally and globally

#Algorithms are recursive
• Algorithm is repeated until a desired level of harmony in achieved, or until the resources run out
• With each succeeding step, coherence of total design is improved
• Next step locates (makes obvious) new bottleneck to coherence
