# Universal Scaling Hierarchy #
  - Alternate terms of the Fibonacci Sequence are a check for subdivisions in an adaptive design.
    -{1, 3, 8, 21, 55, 144, 377, 987, 2584, ... }
  -Constraints make design easier by narrowing down choices.
  -on the smaller scales that the difference is really dramatic
  -Commensurate with universal scaling, edges or centers should have a lip
      - Use ratios of lengths to aid design
      - dimensions of objects measured along the same direction

      Human sensory systems
      - Have evolved to respond to natural geometries of fractals, colors, scaling, symmetries
      - Fine-tuned to perceive positive aspects (food, friends, mates) and threats
      - Also fine-tuned to detect pathologies of our body, signaled by the departure from natural geometries
