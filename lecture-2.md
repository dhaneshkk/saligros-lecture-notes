#Fractals#


  -Self Similarity endows Visual Coherence
  
  ##Examples
    -"Smallest details" are most effectively used on regions "closest to users".
    -Structural information is never lost by zooming into the area of detail.
    -Sometimes detail is distributed all over — Hindu temples with sculptures.

    -Gravity influences curvature, thickens capitals and bases
    -Biophilic constraints on the “push-pull” model
    -Human physiological sensors orient us with the vertical and horizontal axes
    -Diagonals generate distress, except when symmetry creates an implicit vertical axis
    -BOTH PUSH ->| OR |>- PULL CAN ACT HORIZONTALLY
    -Because we evolved with gravity, ONLY PUSH CAN ACT VERTICALLY!

      -should have facade for human beings to be able to relate to  
      -should have adaptivity to senses.
      -Anxiety-inducing horizontals should be enclosed by vertical frame.
