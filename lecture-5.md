#Architectural Harmony#
  -Architectural Harmony is Harmony estimates density of symmetries, connections, scaling coherence, universal scaling, universal distribution, etc. 
  -Architectural Harmony can be computed sum of estimation of the following attributes
      -Refelectional Symmetries at all levels
      -Transalational Symmetries at all levels 
      -Rotational Symmetries at all levels
      -Scaling Symmetries at all levels
      -Geometerical Connections
      -Color Harmonization
  -Method of Estimation
      -None =0,Some,Noticeable=1, A great Deal=2
  -Each of the 5 components of the architectural harmony adds up to give a percentage measure.
