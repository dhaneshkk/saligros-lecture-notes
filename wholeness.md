#Theory of Centers- 15 Principles  of Wholness.#
 
  -1. Levels of Scales.
      -Use logarithmic constant e and the Fibonacci sequence(1,3,8,21...).
      -spaced closely enough for coherence, but not too close to blur the distinction between nearby scales
  -2. Strong Centers
      -Each “center” ties a substantial region of space together coherently
      -Each center combines surrounding centers and boundaries to focus
      -Centers support each other on every scale — recursive hierarchical property
      -Visual focus enhances function
  -3. Boundaries.
      -An “implied” center is defined only through a thick boundary
      -Therefore, thick boundaries play a focusing role as well as a bounding role
  -4. Local Symmetries
      -Symmetries within hierarchy
      -Within universal scaling, symmetries must act on every scale
      -“Symmetry” does not mean overall symmetry, as is usually envisioned
      -We have multiple subsymmetries acting within larger symmetries
      -Hierarchically nested symmetries
  -5. Alternating Repitations (Recursion) Informational definition
      -Contrast and repetition reinforce each other through alternation
      -simplistic repetition is collapsible information
  -6. Echoes (Patterns)
      -Two types of echoes:
        -A. Translational symmetry — similar forms found on the same scale but at a distance
        -B. Scaling symmetry — similar forms exist at different scales
        -All natural fractals obey fractal similarity — not exactly similar when magnified, but only “echoes”
  -7. Positive Space
      -Refers to Gestalt psychology
      -Convexity plays a major role in defining an object or a space (area or volume)
      -Apply positive space concept to both figure and background
      -Threat felt from objects sticking out
  -8. Good Shape
      -Symmetries reduce information overload
      -Perceivable objects produce a represented shape from 2-D views, which the brain can computationally manipulate in 3-D
      -“Good” means “easily graspable” — brain’s innate need to compactify information
      -Shapes not easily represented strain the computation, hence induce anxiety 
  -9. Simplicity- Inner Calm More subtle quality
      -Lack of clutter — a separate property
      -Balance achieved by overall coherence
      -Symmetries all cooperating to support each other — nothing extraneous or distracting
      -Appears effortless (though such coherence is in fact very difficult to achieve)
      -"Simple” in nature means extremely complex but highly coherently
 
 -10. Connectedness (Non Seprateness)-Achieving coherence-goal of adaptive design
      -Coherence is an emergent property — not present in the individual components
      -In a larger coherent whole, no piece can be taken away
      -Decomposition is neither obvious, nor possible
      -When every component is cooperating to give a coherent whole, nothing looks separate, nothing draws attention
      -The opposite of willful separateness
      -Not-separateness goes beyond internal coherence
      -The whole connects to its environment
      -Connects with everything beyond itself
      -Try as much as possible to generate large-scale coherence
  
  -11. Deep Interlaock(Ambiquity)
      -Forms interpenetrate to link together
      -Abrupt transition does not bind
  -12. Roughness
      -Symmetry breaking (approximate) prevents informational collapse
      -Deliberate roughness in repetition
      -Sustainability implies adaptation
      -Local conditions create roughness — breaks regularity and perfect symmetry
      -The whole changes according to its context thus it becomes unique
      -HIERARCHY: sustainability; adaptivity; uniqueness; roughness
 -13. Contrast
      -It is necessary to  
          -A. To establish distinct subunits
          -B. To distinguish between adjoining units
          -C. To provide figure-ground symmetry of opposites • False transparency reduces contrast
      -• Reduced contrast weakens the design
      -• Use contrast with interlock 
  -14. Gradients - transitions
      -Getting away from uniformity
      -Subdivision does that, but sometimes we should not quantize form into discrete pieces, but need to change it gradually

  -15. The Void
      -Largest scale of fractal
      -Largest open component of a fractal survives as the void
      -Not possible to fill in all of a fractal with detail
      -In “implied” centers, a complex boundary focuses on the open middle — the void
FACE OF TIGER has almost all the properties of above
